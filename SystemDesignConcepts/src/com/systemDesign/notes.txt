Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces,
 and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user 
 requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase. The goal is to 
 create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while
  considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.
